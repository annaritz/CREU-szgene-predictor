Top-ranked genes that were not part of our positive gold standard and are likely to be associated with autism,,,,
Gene,Rank,Notes on evidence for ASD-association,,
GNAO1,3,Variants in GNAO1 –encoding G-proteins that couple to receptors that function in the central nervous system– give rise to motor defects with associated behavioral phenotypes20 and can cause involuntary movements as well as severe developmental delay [1].,,
SYT1,5,"Synaptic membrane protein in the CNV 12q21.2-21.31, which has been observed to be duplicated or deleted in autism cases in two large case-control studies [2, 3].",,
SYN2,7,"Has replicated evidence for maternally-inherited frame-shift and missense mutations associated with male ASD cases [4]; Syn2 deleted mice show impaired social behavior and memory, as well as abnormal exploration of novel environments [5].",,
ATXN1,8,"Deleted in five out of six clinical cases, most of whom had ASD, developmental speech delay, and ADHD [6]; Originally used as a negative example, suggesting our classifier is robust to mistakes in gene labeling.",,
ANK2,9,"Two independent cases in the Simons Simplex Collection have been identified to harbor de novo nonsense mutations in the neuronal ankyrin gene [7, 8].",,
OLFM1,14,"A largely uncharacterized gene within 9q33.2-34.4, a CNV with 5 duplications reported in autism cases [3].",,
GNB1,15,"Experimentally connected to known autism-associated genes and processes (e.g., GNB1 is a target of FMRP [9] and involved in synaptic transmission).",,
CTNND2,16,Loss of function of the delta catenin contributes to severe autism [10].,,
PUM2,17,"Deficiency of the mouse homolog of PUM2, an RNA-binding protein, has been shown cause spontaneous seizures and other neurobehavioral defects in mice [11].",,
NOVA1,18,"Resides in the CNV 14q11.2-21.1; two cases with duplication of this CNV are found to suffer from developmental delay, intellectual disability, or ASD [3].",,
SEMA6D,20,"Linked to developmental language disorders (DLD), harboring recurrent mutations in DLD cases against none in controls [31]; also, 15q21, the genomic region containing SEMA6D, has been implicated in autism [32].",,
