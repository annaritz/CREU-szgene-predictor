## This directory contains "trimmed" networks of the GIANT brain top network.
## You can use the files as-is - each file is named as 
## 
## brain_top_geq_X.XXX.txt
##
## where the X.XXX is the probability threshold. Edges in this file are greater
## than or equal to this probability threshold (hence the 'geq' in the name).

## To re-generate these files, do the following:
## (1) download and uncompress the brain_top network from 
## GIANT (http://hb.flatironinstitute.org/download)
##
## (2) Run the script (located in ../../../utils):
## python3 trim_network.py
##
## This script will print something to the screen every million lines.  The
## output at the bottom of the file will look like this:
